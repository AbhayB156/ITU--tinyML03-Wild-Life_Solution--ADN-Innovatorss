Preliminary Iteration - (This depects the multidevice architecture)

For the moile application I have used flutter along with google firebase - RTDB & Authentication and Bing Maps APIs to make a robust backend architecture along with a seamless frontend - user interface.<br />  
-> Firebase RTDB conducts data acquisition and analytics of the sensory and classification result values sent by the hardware-embedded application.<br />
-> Authentication feature of Firebase allows access to registered users only and keeps a track of the activity.<br />
-> The Bing Maps API locates the co-ordinates at which the species was spotted and marks it with a map-marker around the vicinity of the device.

# Initial & Final Casings
For the initial casing I opted an open structure to efficiently debug the device and make possible adjustmets.

By the final iteration the exact device dimensions were determined and a protected casing has been developed.

# ML Model
->The model architecture is supported by Tensorflow Lite and has proven to be highly efficient as demonstrated in the demo videos.<br />  
->It's crossplatform deployability is also evident by the seamless integration with Mobile App.<br />  
->Their is potential for a product deployment as an ebtire architecture.
